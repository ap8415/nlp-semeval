The results in this file were generated using a simple LSTM architecture, involving:
- an embedding layer
- a LSTM layer
- a linear layer to obtain predictions, activated with log-softmax to obtain normalized probabilities for all the classes
The class selected is the argmax of the predictions vector
- preprocessing by removing emoticons, stemming and lemmatizing.
